This challenge combines **React + TypeScript learning** with **daily algorithm problem solving**.  
**Goal:** Build solid frontend development skills while improving logic and problem-solving abilities.  
**Rules:**  
- Do **both tracks** each day (React/TS + Algorithm).  
- Push your progress to GitHub daily.  
- Check ✅ when completed.
