30-day coding algorithm challenge so that it starts with super beginner-friendly problems and slowly ramps up in difficulty.

Here’s how I structure them:

Day 1–10 → Super basic logic & syntax practice (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)

Day 11–20 → Arrays, strings, simple algorithms (sorting basics, search, counting)

Day 21–30 → Beginner-friendly algorithm patterns (two-pointer, basic recursion, simple math problems)


Day 1 Question: Print "Hello, World!" and Your Name
Goal: Learn how to print output to the console in Python and JavaScript.
Why: This is the traditional first coding problem, it teaches you how to run code, check output, and write your first program.
